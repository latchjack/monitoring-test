## Release History

+ 1.0 - This was built within the 4 hour limit so for any improvements I've planned to implement I will be done in a new repository.

## Getting Started
If you would like to start this project please fork and in the Terminal, CD into the `frontend` directory. Once there, `yarn` to install dependencies. Then `yarn start` to get the project running. You can then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

## Challenges and Improvements

### Challenges
The main challenges I had on this project were...
1. Getting the individual films to display. I managed to get the index page up and running fairly quickly, but found it quite tricky to route to another *page* which would display just a single film.

### Improvements
The improvements I would like to make on this game would be the following...
1. Getting the individual pages working.
2. Converting the unix timestamps into the 24 hour format.
3. Rank the titles using the amount of total viewings they've had.

Overall I found this really fun but found I needed a some more time to add more functionality. I will definitely have another attempt of this without the 4 hour limit.
